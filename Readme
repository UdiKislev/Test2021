The Feed Forward calculation and Calibration

CalibrateTurn command - run the robot with specific left/right power for 2 seconds, then read the velocities
Calibrate Command - run multiple CalibrateTurn commands and than analyze the data to calculate the KV/KS/HR/HL values

Calculations for Stright driving - same velocity in left and right
    The precent power is KV + KS * Velocity
    KV is the precent voltage required to overcome all friction and ressistance - this is a constant value that is not affected by velocity
    KS is the precent voltage that is required to overcome the generated voltage of the motor - this is linear with velocity
    
Calculatiobs for Turining with different required Velocity
    Calculate the "base velocity" based on HR/HL
      base Velocity = High Veocity + Low Velocity * (LR/(LH-LR))
    Calculate outer (high velocity) Power
      Outer Percent Power = KV + KS * base Velocity
    Calculate the inner (low) Power
      Inner Percent Power = Outer Power - (base Velocity - low Velocity) * LR

Explanation:
    Using the KV + KS*Velocity for left/right velocity give poor result as there are relation between left/right side
    When setting power for Stright for velocity V (using the KV + KS*V formula) we maintain the V velocity on both sides
    When lowering the power of one side - the result is that both side have lower Velocity - but the side with the low power is "losing"" more velocity
    With many tests we figure that the "lose"velocity is linear with the reduce power, the outer velocity is losing velocity with HR ratio and the inner with the LR ratio
    When the required velocities are Vh and Vl - we can calculate the "base Velocity" using the HR/HL :
        base Velocity is Vh + X
        X*HR = (Vh+X-Vl)*HL
        X = Vh + Vl*LR/(HR-LR)
    The outer power is the power to go stright with that velocity - KV + KS * base Velocity
    The inner power is outer Power - (base Velocity-Vl) * LR
    
 Finding the parametrs:
    Running the robot forward and back with known power:
      0.4/0.4
      0.4,0.1
      0.3/0.3
      0.3/0.1
    We are getting the V44, V33, V41-HIGH v41-LOW and V31-HIGH V31-LOW
    KS = (0.4-0.1)/(V44-V33)
    KV = average of (0.4 - V44*KS), (0.3-V33*KS)
    HR = average of (0.4 - 0.1)/(V44-V41-HIGH), (0.3-0.1)/(V33- V31-HIGH)
    LR = average of (0.4 - 0.1)/(V44-V41-LOW), (0.3-0.1)/(V33- V31-LOW)
